            "summary": "<strong> Vice President John Connally</strong> has come a long way from being the water boy of Lyndon Johnson. After getting stained with Jack Kennedy's blood, John worked to become more than just another one of Lyndon's lackeys. In Dick Nixon, Connally has found yet another venue to crawl up the ranks of power once more. With Connally's confidence and charm, Nixon has found himself inexplicably enamored with the man. <p> With the President's blessing, John Connally has found himself as the steward for Dick's legacy. With the Nixon name still being political gold, in spite of the downturn the nation has faced since Dick's landslide over Senator McGovern in 1972, the nation seems ready to tread the Nixonian line for four more years. The only way Dick's legacy could be tarnished now is through a political scandal of unprecedented proportions, but there's no way that could happen now, right?",

If John Connally were forced to answer that question truthfully, however, he wouldn't really know. <p>\n\nWhat has he done for this country? Well, he helped Dick shock the economy into working again, helped him in getting reelected, he governed the Lone Star state for the better part of a decade. Of course, none of this matters. John Connally is a political chameleon. A former Democrat and Johnson acolyte has fallen right into the hands of the next strongman in power, and has charmed him into letting him become the one that comes after him. <p>\n\nConnally will not let this opportunity slip him by. He will become the next President of the United States off the backs of those who once pulled his strings. If he simply stays the steady course laid out for him, he will breeze to November, and finally reach the White House.",

Why? Because he is clean, youthful, and experienced. His hawkish stances will rally the base, his clean record will help clear up the aura of corruption tainting the Nixon Administration after Agnew's resignation. With an extensive record, Rumsfeld has racked up quite the name for himself in Washington. Despite relations with Nixon having been much cooler in his second term, he is still favored by him. <p> With his career prospects already seeming bright, Rumsfeld has found himself a place as the Vice Presidential Nominee for the Republican Party.
